# System Transfer

_Transfer your files to another computer_

A work in progress app to help transfer files to another computer (which could be a new one for example)

It's written in C++ and QML and uses cmake to build

I'll probably make it use `rsync` to transfer the files when I get to that bit

Currently (as of 3rd August 2022) it just implements service annoucing/discovery via DNS-SD (aka Avahi)
